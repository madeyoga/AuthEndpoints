# Settings, certificates, and user checks

## Settings

| Option | Default | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| `Issuer` | required | Absolute; `https` unless `DisableTransportSecurityRequirement`. Use the app root (`https://host/`), or the app's `PathBase`. |
| `Audience` | required | Default resource and the only audience this host accepts. |
| `AdditionalResources` | empty | Other resources clients may request (validated elsewhere). |
| `Scopes` / `DefaultScopes` | empty | `offline_access` is always registered. |
| `AlwaysIssueRefreshToken` | `true` | Adds `offline_access` when the client has the refresh grant. |
| `LoginUrl`, `LoginReturnUrlParameter` | required, `returnUrl` | |
| `ConsentUrl`, `ConsentRequestParameter` | required, `request` | |
| `AuthenticationScheme`, `UserIdClaimType` | Identity cookie, `NameIdentifier` | |
| `AccessTokenLifetime` | 15 minutes | |
| `RefreshTokenLifetime` | 30 days | Rotating, no reuse leeway. |
| `AuthorizationCodeLifetime` | 5 minutes | |
| `ConsentLifetime` | 10 minutes | |
| `DeveloperApps` | approval off, 10 apps, 10 redirects | See [Developer apps](developer-apps.md). |
| `CleanupInterval`, `PruneAfter` | 1 hour, 14 days | Background sweep of unused clients, developer apps without an owner, expired consents, old tokens. Zero turns it off; `IOAuthServerCleanup.SweepAsync` runs it on demand. |
| `RevalidateUser` | `true` | Re-check the approving user on every code exchange and refresh. |
| `DisableTransportSecurityRequirement` | `false` | Local development only. |
| `DisableResourceValidation` | `false` | Token endpoint only. Authorize still accepts configured resources only. |
| `IgnoreResourcePermissions` | `false` | Skips per-client `rsrc:` permissions. |

The fixed routes are in `OAuthServerConstants`. Anything else can be set on `OAuthServerBuilder.OpenIddict`.

## Certificates

Set exactly one source in `options.Certificates`:

| Setting | Use it for |
| --- | --- |
| `Path` | A self-signed RSA signing and encryption pair, created on first start in that directory and reused. Treat the directory like Data Protection keys: persistent, private, and shared by every instance. Files are created with owner-only permissions on Linux and macOS. |
| `SigningCertificate` + `EncryptionCertificate` | Certificates you manage (Key Vault, a mounted secret, the machine store). Both need a private key. |
| `UseEphemeralKeys` | Tests and local runs only. Keys are lost on restart, which invalidates every issued token. |

To rotate, add the new certificates through `builder.OpenIddict.AddServer(o => o.AddSigningCertificate(…))` before removing the old ones, so tokens signed with the old key still validate until they expire.

## When the user changes

Each grant remembers the user who approved it and that user's security stamp. On every code exchange and refresh, the server checks that the user still exists, can sign in (`SignInManager.CanSignInAsync`), is not locked out, and has the same security stamp. If any check fails, the request gets `invalid_grant`, and the authorization and all its tokens are revoked.

Identity changes the security stamp when the password changes or is reset, an authenticator is reset, two-factor is turned off, or an external login is removed. Call `UserManager.UpdateSecurityStampAsync(user)` to end every OAuth grant for a user on demand, for example from a "sign out everywhere" button.

The check happens at the token endpoint, so an access token that was already issued keeps working until it expires (15 minutes by default) or until the client next refreshes. To stop it sooner, call `IOAuthConsentService.RevokeAuthorizationAsync`.

The approving user's id and stamp are stored in the code and refresh token only. They are never copied into access tokens, even when a principal factory sends every claim to the access token. Replace `IOAuthUserValidator` to apply your own rules, or set `RevalidateUser = false` to turn the check off.

## Protected resource metadata (optional)

For APIs whose clients discover the authorization server on their own (MCP clients, for example):

```csharp
options.ProtectedResource.Enabled = true;
options.ProtectedResource.ResourceName = "My API";
options.ProtectedResource.ChallengePaths.Add("/mcp");

app.UseOAuthResourceChallenge(); // before UseAuthentication
```

`GET /.well-known/oauth-protected-resource` returns `Audience`, the issuer, and the scopes. A `401` on a challenge path gets `WWW-Authenticate: Bearer resource_metadata="…/.well-known/oauth-protected-resource"`. Existing `Bearer` parameters are kept.
