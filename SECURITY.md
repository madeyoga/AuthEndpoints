## Reporting a Vulnerability

To report a vulnerability or a security-related issue, please send an email to m26416083@alumni.petra.ac.id with the details of the vulnerability. We will respond swiftly to fix verifiable security issues.

**Do not file public issues on GitHub for security vulnerabilities**. Security vulnerabilities should be reported privately, to minimize attacks against current users of AuthEndpoints package before they are fixed.
